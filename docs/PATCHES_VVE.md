# Vanilla Vehicles Expanded - List of Patches
## Tier 1

### Bang Bus

Although it does its job well, the Bang Bus' fuel consumption was quite unreasonable, was too fast and had too little carry capacity, whilst having no extra offroad penalties at all. Its fuel capacity was revised to endure longer trips as well.

| Variable | Old Value | New Value | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fuel Consumption | 14.5 | 29 | +100% |
| Fuel Capacity | 80 | 150 | +88% |
| Movement Speed | 10.4 | 9.6 | -8% |
| Offroad Penalty | 1x | 1.7x | +70% |
| Cargo Capacity | 140 | 200 | +43% |

### Bunsen

If Roadkill is underpowered then Bunsen is micropowered. Sorry for the bad joke.

But this tank truly is in a very sorry state, so much so that it's worse than the Highwayman in every aspect possible while having a weapon that is infinitely more situational. Even its armor is, in average, comparable to the Highwayman's.

This being a tank that's supposed to reminisce a Medium or even a Light Anti-Personnel tank, its armor cannot be neither too strong nor too weak, but definitely more resistant than the Highwayman's, being able to strike the middle ground between a frontlining tank like the Roadkill whilst having more resilience than dying to just a few LMG salvos.

| Variable | Old Value | New Value | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CE - Base Armor | 5/10 | 16/32[^1] | +220% |
| CE - Track Armor | 5/10 | 10/20 | +100% |
| CE - Sprocket Health | 20 | 50 | +150% |
| Fuel Consumption | 29.5 | 42 | +42% |
| World Map Fuel Consumption | 0.8x | 1x | +25% |
| Fuel Capacity | 120 | 75[^2] | -38% |
| World Map Speed | 1x | 1.1x | +10% |
| Offroad Penalty | 1x | 1.4x | +40% |

### Dirtbike

The normal Dirtbike sits at a very awkward position. It is cheap to build, true, but it's rather slow and consumes too much fuel for a motorcycle with a very low carry capacity and that carries a single passenger.

It being a Dirtbike, it'll have one of the best offroad performances despite being T1 - even beating its successor's. Even then, its performance shouldn't beat a normal human's since it has agility and offroad wheels, sure, but it doesn't have legs, and nothing is more versatile than legs.

All in all, it's meant to be an excellent alternative for going from one point to another in a fashionable speed while not being the best option to do so during winter, being beaten by the Prowler in that regard.

| Variable | Old Value | New Value | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fuel Consumption | 12.5 | 9 | -28% |
| Movement Speed | 12 | 18 | +50% |
| Winter Speed Penalty | 3.2x | 2.5x | -22% |
| Offroad Penalty | 0.8x | 1.1x | +38% |

### Highwayman

Hands down the strongest T1 combat vehicle, the Highway was only nerfed in terms of fuel usage and mobility in rough terrain. No other adjustments were necessary.

| Variable | Old Value | New Value | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fuel Consumption | 24.5 | 40 | +63% |
| World Map Fuel Consumption | 0.8x | 1x | +25% |
| Fuel Capacity | 80 | 105 | +31% |
| Movement Speed | 9.2 | 10 | +9% |
| Winter Speed Penalty | 1.5x | 1.6x | +7% |
| Offroad Penalty | 1x | 1.5x | +50% |
| Cargo Capacity | 180 | 100 | -44% |

### Mule

The vanilla Mule is a surprisingly efficient Tier 1 transport vehicle. Even though its cargo capacity isn't very impressive, its speed and fuel consumption are superior to virtually all of its Tier 1 counterparts while having the cargo transportation specialization. If anything, speed and fuel efficiency shouldn't be its top qualities.

Its fuel capacity also was revised to allow for longer hauls despite its fuel inefficiency.

| Variable | Old Value | New Value | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fuel Consumption | 18 | 32 | +78% |
| World Map Fuel Consumption | 0.5x | 1x | +100% |
| Fuel Capacity | 80 | 180 | +125% |
| Movement Speed | 10 | 9.1 | -9% |
| Winter Speed Penalty | 3.2x | 2.5x | -29% |
| Offroad Penalty | 1x | 1.6x | +60% |

### Prowler

Although it's not the fastest vehicle, the Prowler is meant to excel in exploration due to its good performance in offroad environments and ease to travel during winter while having a reasonable fuel efficiency whilst carrying a single person.

Its cargo capacity had to be diminished however since it was borderline excessive for a mere light exploration vehicle.

| Variable | Old Value | New Value | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fuel Consumption | 18.5 | 12 | -35% |
| Winter Speed Penalty | 2x | 1.4x | -35% |
| Offroad Penalty | 1x | 1.2x | +20% |
| Cargo Capacity | 220 | 120 | -45% |

### Roadkill

This vehicles was the reason why I took the initiative to make this patch since most of a vehicle's stats can be tweaked via the ingame Vehicle Framework interface, except for the armor which is what most brought me discomfort with it.

Without this patch, a few LMG salvos was enough to tear its front armor plating down, which was supposed to be this vehicle's highlight. Its front and side armors were enhanced in order to rectify that.

The vehicle is nowhere immortal, mind you. LMG and HMG emplacement shots will still tear through it - they just need many more salvos to apply any real damage.

The front Sprocket armor was fixed as well. Before, they had the same armor value as the back armor, meaning the tank would have its tracks rendered useless with just a few shots regardless of the front plating.

Lastly, it was made much slower to represent a slow, old-tech tank that would be in overall inefficient when compared to modern alternatives, despite its regained usefulness due to the gained armor.

| Variable | Old Value | New Value | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CE - Front Armor | 10/20 | 30/60 | +200% |
| CE - Side Armor | 8/16 | 15/30 | +87.5% |
| CE - Track Armor | 5/10 | 10/20 | +100% |
| CE - Front Sprocket Armor | 5/10 | 25/50 | +400% |
| CE - Front Sprocket Health | 20 | 60 | +200% |
| Fuel Consumption | 28.5 | 47 | +65% |
| World Map Fuel Consumption | 1.2x | 1x | -17% |
| Fuel Capacity | 60 | 110 | +83% |
| Movement Speed | 6.6 | 5.2 | -21% |
| Winter Speed Penalty | 2x | 1.7x | -15% |
| Offroad Penalty | 1x | 1.4x | +40% |

### Scytheman

It's a tractor pulling a missile artillery set. With it, two things are certain:
1) it's slow;
2) doesn't have a lot armor.

All in all, it got quite nerfed because not only is it a very good vehicle given its excellence in what it does (missiles are very strong btw) but it also was a bit too good in the mobility aspect, which is something that neither tractors nor self-propelled artillery should excel in.

| Variable | Old Value | New Value | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fuel Consumption | 21 | 35 | +67% |
| Fuel Capacity | 60 | 90 | +50% |
| Movement Speed | 8.6 | 6.1 | -29% |
| Winter Speed Penalty | 0.7x | 1.8x | +157% |
| Offroad Penalty | 1x | 1.4x | +40% |

### Traveller

Being the only personal vehicle choice for T1 that isn't a motorcycle, the Traveller is an improvised muscle car which therefore will be reasonably fast but with limited offroad capabilities and consuming a lot of fuel.

Its cargo capacity was reduced since a muscle car half of the Mule's capacity is pretty crazy.

| Variable | Old Value | New Value | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fuel Consumption | 22.5 | 27 | +20% |
| Movement Speed | 12.8 | 15 | +17% |
| Offroad Penalty | 1.2x | 1.8x | +50% |
| Cargo Capacity | 300 | 165 | -45% |

## Tier 2

### Charley

Even though Charley should be the Dirtbike's direct successor, I believe that its appearance and overall stats should represent a different purpose other than specializing in offroad environments. It'd be more interesting to reshape it so that it is a motorcycle that is better suited to traveling on roads with a higher speed and slightly better fuel and cargo capacity, at the expense of having a worse offroad performance and slightly less fuel efficient.

| Variable | Old Value | New Value | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fuel Consumption | 14.5 | 10 | -31% |
| World Map Fuel Consumption | 0.8x | 1x | +25% |
| Fuel Capacity | 50 | 40 | -20% |
| Movement Speed | 12.8 | 21 | +64% |
| Winter Speed Penalty | 2x | 2.6x | +30% |
| Offroad Penalty | 0.8x | 1.3x | +63% |
| Cargo Capacity | 60 | 20 | -67% |

### Roadrunner

It is a pickup truck that should succeed the Mule but, much like with Charley, I made it better than its predecessor but in different ways. It doesn't have a higher cargo capacity nor a bigger fuel tank but, in exchange, it has a much better offroad performance and fuel efficiency while being a much faster alternative. All in all, it's better suited in almost any circumstance when compared to the Mule.

| Variable | Old Value | New Value | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fuel Consumption | 20.5 | 25 | +22% |
| World Map Fuel Consumption | 0.5x | 1x | +100% |
| Fuel Capacity | 120 | 140 | +17% |
| Winter Speed Penalty | 2x | 1.7x | -15% |
| Movement Speed | 14.8 | 12.5 | -16% |
| Offroad Penalty | 1x | 1.3x | +30% |

[^1]: The Bunsen had multiple armor settings for many of its parts, so everything was standardized to the same value with the exception of its internal components, which retained their original values.
